<p>Where does the classroom sit in the School&rsquo;s new Learning Ecosystem?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to align with 21<sup>st</sup> century classroom renewal efforts, we must make sure that the time learners invest attending courses at the School maximizes the potential of the participants and provides direct positive&nbsp; impact for the sponsoring organizations.</p>
<p>How do we manage this? Part of the answer is that we use active learning!</p>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong> In this workshop, you will be completely immersed in an active learning environment; you will experience and explore multiple dimensions of this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Length:</strong> &nbsp;6 hours</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> instructional designers, facilitators, faculty (priority for these three groups). Any other School employee who is curious or is interested in training can also attend.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> This is NOT a workshop on technology. The workshop is an overview and a great introduction to active learning in a classroom environment.</p>
<p>For this workshop to be successful, we require a minimum number of participants: 24 spots are available for each session</p>
<p>Share the news with your colleagues, bring a buddy, or come with your entire team!</p>
<p>We will send you the logistics details later on.</p>
<p>This workshop on active learning will be followed by more specific and shorter workshops. It will also be offered again during the year. Keep an eye open!</p>
<p><em>This workshop will only be offered in-person (no virtual attendance). Please contact Annie Leblond or Doug Brubacher if you would like to speak with us about having the workshop delivered in your region. </em>&nbsp;</p>
