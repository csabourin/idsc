    <h2>WCAG&nbsp;2.0 AA</h2>Web technologies and standards are constantly
    evolving and web accessibility plays a major role in making the Government
    of Canada Web channel more effective and inclusive. To meet the Government
    of Canada commitment to Web accessibility, the Government of Canada has
    adopted the WCAG 2.0. The WCAG 2.0 states:
    <blockquote>
      Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider
      range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision,
      deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive
      limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity
      and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often
      make your Web content more usable to users in general.

    <p>
      The Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) adheres to WCAG 2.0 AA
      standards in order to provide the best possible web-browsing and online
      learning experience possible for its clients and personnel. As a CSPS
      Instructional Designer, you have the responsibility of ensuring WCAG 2.0 AA
      compliance at every stage of product design and development which you
      partake in.

    <h3>WCAG Guidelines and Principles</h3>
    <p>
      WCAG&nbsp;2.0 has 12&nbsp;guidelines that are organized under 4
      principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each
      guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels:
      25 at A, 13 at AA, and 23 at AAA. (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php</a>)

        <h3>Principles</h3>
      </summary>
      <h4>Perceivable</h4>
      <p>
        Information and user interface components must be presentable to
        users in ways they can perceive.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This means that users must be able to perceive the information
          being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p />
      <h4>Operable</h4>
      <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This means that users must be able to operate the interface
          (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot
          perform)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Understandable</h4>
      <p>
        Information and the operation of user interface must be
        understandable.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This means that users must be able to understand the
          information as well as the operation of the user interface (the
          content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Robust</h4>
      <p>
        Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by
        a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This means that users must be able to access the content as
          technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the
          content should remain accessible)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If any of these are not true, users with disabilities will not be
        able to use the Web.

        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
      </summary>
      <p>
        Under each guideline, there are Success Criteria that describe
        specifically what must be achieved in order to conform to this
        standard. They are similar to the "checkpoints" in WCAG&nbsp;1.0. Each
        Success Criterion is written as a statement that will be either true or
        false when specific Web content is tested against it. The Success
        Criteria are written to be technology neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        All WCAG&nbsp;2.0 Success Criteria are written as testable criteria
        for objectively determining if content satisfies the Success Criteria.
        While some of the testing can be automated using software evaluation
        programs, others require human testers for part or all of the test.<br>
        (<a href="http://www.w3.o../../UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-layers-head" target="_blank">http://www.w3.o../../UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-layers-head</a>)
      </p>
      <h3>What are levels A, AA and AAA?</h3>Levels A, AA and AAA correspond to
      WCAG success criteria levels. In simplified terms, these levels mean:
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Without level A: some people will find it impossible</li>
        <li>Without level AA: some people will find it difficult</li>
        <li>Without level AAA: some people will miss full impact</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For your content to be Level AA compliant, you must meet all Level A and
        Level AA standards.
