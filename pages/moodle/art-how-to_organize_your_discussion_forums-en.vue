    <h2>How to Organize Your Discussion Forum</h2>
    <p>
      Merely putting learners into an online forum for discussion does not necessarily lead to learning taking place. Indeed, discussion
      forums can far too easily degenerate into a swapping of opinions between learners, without any change in understanding, attitudes or
      knowledge. Thus the teacher's role in moderating online discussions is critical.

      What is the optimum group size for an online discussion? This will depend on a number of factors, but some general guidelines can be given:
      <strong>a teacher-learner ratio of between 20-30 learners is recommended</strong>, for both pedagogical and workload reasons. A minimum
      class size is needed to generate good discussion, especially as not all learners will actively participate. Learners do not all work at the
      same pace and so not all learners are ready at the same time to participate in a particular topic. Learners also need to develop experience
      and confidence to participate fully and well in online discussion forums.
