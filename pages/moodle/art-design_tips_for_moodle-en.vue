    <h2>Tips for designing a course in Moodle</h2>

    <h4>Select the right activity or resource</h4>
    <p>
      Use the <a href="http://www.cats-pyjamas.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/MoodleToolGuideforTeachers_May2010_JS.pdf" download>Moodle Tool Guide
        for Teacher</a> to make sure you are selecting the most appropriate activity or resource that will help you reach you objectives.
      Moodle has a wide variety of tools available, each with their respective purpose.
    </p>

    <h4>Use labels</h4>
    <p>
      On your course home page, use labels to separate each topics or sections and to make the page look pretty. Labels
      will help give a structure to your page. You can add images, instructions or any relevant information you want your learner to know.
      You can also use the summary box under the topic edit page.
    </p>

    <h4>Engage your learner</h4>
    <p>
      Create activities that will engage your learner, create a biography forum and have them introduce themselves, use the group features
      to create working groups, create a wiki where learners can build content together.
    </p>

    <h4>Use question bank</h4>
    <p>
      Create a bank of questions that you can draw from in your quizzes. Questions can be categorized and you can pre-determine how many
      questions to draw from each category when you create a quiz. This will ensure that every time a learner launches a quiz that it is
      different.
    </p>

    <h4>Enlarge the real estate</h4>
    <p>Move or remove the blocks that are on the right portion of your course home page to gain extra space.</p>

    <h4>Lesson VS Book</h4>
    <p>
      You may wonder if you should use books or lessons to present your information. They are quite similar but have different features. A
      book will present the information in a linear manner; the learner can only navigate from one page to other using arrows or the table of
      content. The great thing about the book is that learner can print it in it's entirely or only a certain chapter. The lesson module
      offers more features such as the possibility to create branching scenarios and include questions.
    </p>

    <h4>Don't upload videos</h4>
    <p>
      CSPS has a dedicated video hosting and streaming platform, therefore we recommended that every video should be posted inside that
      platform to ensure better performance. Contact the Studio for more information.
    </p>

    <h4>Using SCORM Packages</h4>
    <p>
      If you want to link to an existing course in ILMS (Self-Paced), it is possible to do so by using the Launch deeplink available in
      ILMS. This is recommended if the self-paced course is mandatory or if completion needs to be tracked. Should you want to add a SCORM
      package that you don't need to have tracked you may use the SCORM Package feature of Moodle.
    </p>

    <h4>Don't copy-paste from Word</h4>
    <p>
      Copy-pasting text from a Word file directly into Moodle will bring obsolete HTML coding. To avoid that, paste your text in Notepad
      and copy it from there. Then paste your copied text from Notepad into Moodle. This will ensure that the HTML code is clean when moved
      over.
