      To customize the way your course looks and behaves, click on <strong>edit settings</strong> in the Course Administration menu. This is where
      you will find information on all the main settings you should know about. To learn more about additional settings not covered here,
      please refer to <a href="//docs.moodle.org/28/en/Course_settings" target="_blank">Moodle.org</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>General&nbsp;Section</h3>

    <p><img src="../../content_sections/moodle/articles/art-setting_up_your_course-en_files/image004.png"></p>

    <p>
      enter the <strong>Course full name</strong> and a <strong>Course short name</strong>. The short name will be displayed in the breadcrumb (as shown
      below), which the learner can click on to return to the course home page. <img

    <h3>Course Format</h3>

    <p><img src="../../content_sections/moodle/articles/art-setting_up_your_course-en_files/image008.png"></p>

    <p>
      There are five formats from which you can choose. By default, your course is on Weekly format, which breaks the course down into the
      number of selected sections. Typically, you would use the Weekly or Topic format. The Topic format will create the number of selected
      sections, which you can then rename as you wish since they are not bound by dates. In the CSPS Moodle, there is an <span
        class="Spelle"
      >GCcampus</span> <strong>format</strong>. It is similar to the Topic format but different in that the sections are displayed as blocks.
      The learner clicks on these blocks to access each topic (as shown below).

    <h3>Appearance</h3>

    <p>
      <img src="../../content_sections/moodle/articles/art-setting_up_your_course-en_files/image012.png" class="float-left"><strong>Force Theme</strong>: Set to the <span class="Spelle">GCcampus</span> theme; this will prevent learners from applying a different theme
      to the site.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Force Language</strong>: Set to the language of the course; for english, use<br>
      <strong>english (en).<span /></strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Completion Tracking</h3>

    <p>
      <img src="../../content_sections/moodle/articles/art-setting_up_your_course-en_files/image014.png" class="float-right">By enabling this setting, you can set conditions on how to determine if a learner has completed the course. A <strong>Course
        completion</strong> item will then appear in the Course Administration menu.
    </p>

    <h3>Guest Access</h3>

    <p><img src="../../content_sections/moodle/articles/art-setting_up_your_course-en_files/image016.png"></p>

    <p>Set <strong>Allow guest access</strong> to <i>No</i>. This will prevent unregistered users from accessing the course.</p>

    <p>
      Once you have saved the course settings, Moodle will bring you back to the course home page. The example below shows the default
      format for a Topic format course. To start adding content to your course, click the <strong>Turn editing on</strong> button. This will make new
      buttons appear on the page.
