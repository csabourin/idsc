    <h2>Tips for learner engagement</h2>
    <p>
      The following best practices on discussion forum participation can be included in the participant manual and also be posted in the
      discussion forum itself.

      Remember that online discussions are first and foremost dialogues, <em>not</em> writing assignments. To be successful, you need to
      translate your face-to-face discussion skills to the online environment. The following tips highlight key features of effective online
      discussion strategies:

          <dd>
            Online discussions can generate a number of messages, so you need to consider efficient ways to make your
            contributions. For example, after you've done the required reading or task, think of a thesis and how to support it, then
            read the other postings and see how they support or contradict your idea, and write about this.

          <dt>Feel free to disagree.</dt>
          <dd>
            Disagree with points, not with people. Support your contradicting views with evidence. However, avoid emotional
            postings and sarcasm. Stay on topic and stick to the issues raised.

          <dd>
            Probe for evidence and raise questions. Remember, though, that opinions aren't arguments. Be sure to support what you
            say with references to course materials or outside sources such as readings or examples from experience. Give positive
            feedback, respond in a timely way; try to add value to the discussion by avoiding repetition and by posing questions for
            others to answer.

          <dd>
            Get others thinking (and writing) by making bold statements or including open-ended questions in your message. Those
            who post first are most often responded to and cited by others. Remember to check back to see if and how others have
            responded to your ideas.<br>
            Ask probing questions. Consider using the following samples when trying to extend a discussion:
            <ul type="square">
              <li>What reasons do you have for saying that?</li>
              <li>Why do you agree (or disagree) on that point?</li>
              <li>How are you defining the term that you just used?</li>
              <li>What do you mean by that expression?</li>
              <li>Could you clarify that remark?</li>
              <li>What follows from what you just said?</li>
              <li>What alternatives are there to such a formulation?</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Be concise.</dt>
          <dd>
            Use informative keywords in your title. Make postings short and purposeful. In general, only fill 1âˆ’2 screens (25âˆ’50
            lines of text) because long messages are difficult to read online. Another rule of thumb is to make only one main point in
            each posting, supported by evidence and/or an example.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Make the context clear.</dt>
          <dd>
            An informative title will help, but also consider including a quotation from the original message that you're
            responding to. If the original message is lengthy, cut out what is not relevant to your response. And if the original has
            many paragraphs, place your comments between the paragraphs to give readers the context for your ideas.

            Discussion is about hearing what others have to say and working to shape and re-shape your own thoughts and
            perspectives. Different perspectives can further everyone's understanding of the issue or concept being discussed; they
            represent opportunities for learning. You are allowed to change your mind! Simply indicate that with the new information
            raised in the discussion, you have changed your stance. Learning is about change.

            It can be frustrating to read through a busy discussion forum with lots of posts and replies. Make sure to create new
            threads if new topics evolve in the discussion. "Subscribing" to receive e-mail alerts of new postings can help
            participants keep up with a conversation without checking back into the discussion forum repeatedly.
