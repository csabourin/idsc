    <h2>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</h2>
    <p>Virtual classroom discussions are synchronous in that all students and instructors are online together at a scheduled time, allowing instructors to moderate the discussion. Tools such as live chat facilities allow comments to be typed up and read by the whole group in real time. Social media such as Twitter can also be used to encourage discussion in short bursts of 140 characters, for instance, during a live event or other synchronous activities.</p>

    <p>Although online synchronous discussions allow students to participate from any location, they have to participate at fixed times that may not suit them all,  even though the sessions can be recorded and downloaded later. However, this usually means a fixed schedule (say, once a week) for discussion, as with a classroom.</p>
    <p>Asynchronous discussions, however, are unique to online learning. Students can log in and take part at any time, although there are usually set start and end times for a discussion topic that may nevertheless spread over several weeks or even over the term of a course. Asynchronous discussion boards can be used in conjunction with a blog or as a learning component in conjunction with a self-paced module or in distance-learning models that are structured around collaborative distance learning. </p>
