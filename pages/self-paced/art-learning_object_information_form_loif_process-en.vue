    <h2>Learning Object Information Form (LOIF) Process</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the LOIF process is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Notify stakeholders such as Departmental Client Services, CCC, evaluation, Publishing Services and the Regions of an upcoming Learning Product (could be any delivery type)</li>
      <li>Provide all information required for the proper creation and quality assurance of a catalogue entry in ILMS</li>
      <li>enable the Marketing and Communications team to work with the program areas to craft an appropriate description of the learning product which will assist in its promotion and marketing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process Overview</h3>
    <p>A completed LOIF is comprised of three main components:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Financial Coding (the functional area code is necessary for ILMS Business Operations to provide a legacy code)</li>
      <li>A Legacy Code for your learning product</li>
      <li>Course Title, Course Description and Mapping information supplied in your language of choice and reviewed by the Marketing and Communications team.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All three components need to be completed before your LOIF can be finalized and you have approval to create your learning product/course (depending on delivery type) in ILMS. It is recommended that you start the LOIF early in your Learning Product development process (regardless of delivery type).</p>
    <h3>estimated Timelines</h3>
