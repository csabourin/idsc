    <h2>Storyboarding Template</h2>
    <p>An e-learning storyboard is a visual layout document that indicates all the necessary elements of a course, such as on-screen text, multimedia elements (graphics, audio, video), and any interactive features. The main purpose is to illustrate what you envision for your design, flow and structure of the course, and ensures everyone is on the same page before programming begins. It also helps programmers understand the structure and the sequencing of your course. </p>
