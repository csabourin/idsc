    <p>The Learning Design Plan is to be completed by the learning advisors/instructional designers. This template is intended to offer a framework for the instructional design concepts of an eLearning product. It highlights the design approach, the course outline and objectives, and the overall instructional architecture. Basically, it acts as the blueprint for your course. By answering the questions and completing the tables in this template, you will capture all the key design specifications that should be included in the learning design plan. The completed template should be reviewed and approved by your management team and clients to ensure everyone agrees on the overall design approach.</p>
