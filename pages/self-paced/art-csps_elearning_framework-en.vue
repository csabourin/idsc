    <h2>The CSPS eLearning Framework</h2>
    <h3>What It Is</h3>
    <p>The CSPS eLearning Framework is an online catalogue of the widgets and quizzes used in designing our courses. It serves as a one-stop shop where online course designers will find everything they need to make their courses more interesting and more satisfying for learners.</p>
    <h3>How to Use the CSPS eLearning Framework</h3>
    <p>The CSPS eLearning Framework is made up of two main sections, found under the pull-down menu. The first main section, the “Interactivity Catalog,” is a compilation of all the widgets deemed useful and relevant for designing online courses. Some were chosen from the <a href="//wet-boew.github.io/v4.0-ci/index-en.html" target="_blank">Web experience Toolkit (WeT)</a>, whereas others were created by our team to meet the more specific needs of some clients.</p>
    <p>The second section, “Quiz samples,” contains the different types of quizzes that were drawn from courses of varying levels of difficulty. It offers a multitude of possibilities with regard to tracking learner results and getting feedback. Designers themselves can select the type of feedback they wish to offer learners as well as the types of quizzes they want to use.</p>
    <p>In addition, a thematic section presents the different themes created by our team over the years in various formats (on-screen, mobile, etc.).</p>
