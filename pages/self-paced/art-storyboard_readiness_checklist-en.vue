    <h2>Storyboard Readiness Checklist </h2>
    <p>The Storyboard Readiness Checklist is intended to be used by Learning Advisors. It can be used to ensure that all the essential elements have been included in the storyboard (i.e. navigation, text & style, narration, interactions, graphics and accessibility). It can serve as a final point of review before sending the storyboard to the client. </p>
