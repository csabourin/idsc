    <h2>Service contract</h2>
    <p>The Service Contract is an agreement between the Learning Technologies and Services (LTS) team and the program area. This document provides a rationale for the project and describes its scope, outlining the planned activities with the proposed timelines and resources required. It also highlights the overall roles and responsibilities under the project. It is the responsibility of the Project Authority to complete the service contract. Once signed, it is an agreement in good faith for services between LTS and the program area. Major changes to any terms specified therein must be negotiated between the program area and LTS and confirmed with the Change Request document.</p>
