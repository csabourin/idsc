    <h2>Informal Pilot Feedback form</h2>
    <p>The Informal Pilot Feedback Form is intended to be used by instructional designers who want to evaluate the alpha version of their self-paced online learning products on specific targeted learners internally and externally. The Informal Pilot Feedback Form evaluates their reactions and allows instructional designers to gather valuable feedback from the learners on the content, navigation, overall design and any technical glitches that may be present. Running a pilot will save on costly adjustments made after a product has been launched officially and help you improve your product.</p>
