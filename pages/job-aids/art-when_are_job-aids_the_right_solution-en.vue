        <h4>When using the job aid could damage credibility</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In certain situations, using a job aid could damage the credibility of the user. For example, a supervisor who keeps referring to a checklist while giving feedback to an employee about a sensitive issue is not likely to be seen as caring or competent.</li>
          <li>A job aid that may be appropriate for use in a training situation shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be used in the same way in a real life situation.</li>
          <li>When deciding whether a job aid is an appropriate solution, think carefully about how and when it is to be used. Ask yourself whether the person using the job aid might be seen by others as not having the skills or knowledge required to do the job.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>When a rapid response or quick performance is required</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>There are many work situations where the use of a job aid is not realistic as it might slow down performance where speed is required. For example, an organization might require its employees to process a high number of transactions as quickly and accurately as possible.</li>
          <li>In medical and other emergency situations speed is critical. If a quick response essential and there is no time to refer to a job aid, then performers need to be trained to perform their tasks fluently by heart</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>When unpredictable situations occur</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Job aids are not appropriate for people who find themselves in unique and unpredictable situations. Situations like these require the ability to handle surprises, stresses, and new challenges. For example, organizations expect good judgement from employees when they deal with members of the public who may be nearly hysterical about a situation they are unhappy with.</li>
