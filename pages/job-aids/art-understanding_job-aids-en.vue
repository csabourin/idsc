    <img class="float-left" src="~/assets/job-aids/undestanding_job-aids.jpg" width="30%" height="auto" alt="Computer providing tools to the user">
    <p>A job-aid is a simple tool which provides guidance, instructions or reminders to help users finish a task, make a decision, or carry out a procedure while they are working. A job-aid can include facts, procedures, processes, or concepts.</p>
    <h3>Why use job-aids?</h3>
    <p>Job-aids remind users of important details and steps helping them successfully accomplish an infrequent, new or modified task. Job-aids alone are sometimes enough to help users. Well-designed, job-aids can provide on-demand support that training cannot. In more complex cases, job-aids can accompany training.</p>
    <p>At the School, our new ecosystem strives to provide flexible learning and performance solutions that follow our clients into their workplace at the moment of need. Some solutions allow clients to gain new knowledge while others allow them to improve their competencies and skills. Job-aids allow us to help fill a gap between learning how to do something and applying it on the job.</p>
