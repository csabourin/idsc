    <h2>The five moments of learning need</h2>
    <p>There are times when the most fitting solution for our clients is training. Other times, the most appropriate solution for our needs is a mentor, a community of practice, or a job-aid. Sometimes, a combination of both might be of most value. These <em>times</em> can be grouped into five over-arching moments of learning need:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>  When learning something for the first time</li>
      <li>  When wanting to learn more</li>
      <li>  When trying to remember and/or apply something</li>
      <li>  When something changes</li>
      <li>  When something goes wrong</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>There are times when training, be it in class or online is the most effective approach, mainly:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>When learning something for the first time</li>
      <li>When wanting to learn more</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A performance support tool such as a job-aid can, however, be provided within the context of training for future use and reference.</p>
    <h4>A job-aid is often more effective for the other three moments of need:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>When trying to remember and/or apply something</li>
      <li>When something changes</li>
      <li>When something goes wrong</li>
    </ol>
