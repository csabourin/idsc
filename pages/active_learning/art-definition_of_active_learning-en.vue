    <h2>Definition of Active Learning</h2>
    <p>Active learning is broadly defined as:</p>
    <p>
      <em>“Any learning activity or approach that replaces typical lecture
        methods of instruction and makes learners active participants in the
        learning process. Active learning engages learners in meaningful activities
        and requires that they think about what they are doing and why.”</em>
      (Bonwell & Eisen, 1991)
