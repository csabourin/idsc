    <h2>Classroom of the future</h2>
    <p>
      The Classroom2020 Project, formerly known as Classroom Modernization,
      has been tasked with designing, creating and supporting active learning
      spaces at the School. The mandate includes updating rooms including the
      look, the furniture and the technology; as important though is a renewal of
      the pedagogical foundations used to design and deliver our courses.
