    <h2>Active Learning Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Active learning methods can be grouped into a number of
      strategies.
    </p>
    <p><em>Click on each of the strategies for a quick description.</em></p>
    <details>
      <summary><h4>Problem-based or case-based learning (PBL/CBL)</h4></summary>
      <p>
        Students learn about a subject through the experience of solving
        an open-ended problem. They learn both thinking strategies and
        domain knowledge.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>
        <h4>
          Cooperative/collaborative learning/group work of all
          kinds
        </h4>
      </summary>
      <p>
        Involves groups of learners working together to
        solve a problem, complete a task, or create a product.
        Collaborative learning is based on the idea that learning is a
        naturally social act in which the participants talk among
        themselves.
      </p>

    <details>
      <summary><h4>Conceptual change strategies</h4></summary>
      <p>
        Are strategies
        specifically targeted at changing concepts and the relationships
        between them change over the course of a learning event.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary><h4>Inquiry-based learning (IBL)</h4></summary>
      <p>
        Starts by
        posing questions, problems or scenariosâ€”rather than simply
        presenting established facts or portraying a smooth path to
        knowledge. The inquiry process is often assisted by a
        facilitator.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary><h4>Games-based learning (GBL)</h4></summary>
      <p>
        Is a type of game
        play that has defined learning outcomes. Generally, game based
        learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and
        the ability of the player to retain and apply the subject matter to
        the real world.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary><h4>Discovery learning</h4></summary>
      <p>
        Where the learner draws
        on his own experience and prior knowledge. It is a method of
        instruction through which students interact with their environment
        by exploring and manipulating objects, wrestling with questions and
        controversies, or performing experiments.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary><h4>Technology Enhanced Active Learning (TEAL)</h4></summary>
      <p>
        Is a teaching format that uses technologies to merge lectures,
        simulations, and hands-on desktop experiments to create a rich
        collaborative learning experience.
