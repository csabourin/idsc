    <h2>S.A.M.R. Model</h2>
    <p>
      SAMR stands for substitution, augmentation, modification and
      redefinition, a model popularized by Dr. Ruben Puentedura, is designed to
      help trainers progressively infuse technology into the learning process. It
      provides a progression from simple substitution of technologies, e.g. a
      large screen white board vs. a flipchart, through augmentation,
      modification and finally redefinition at which point the scope and
      objectives of the learning product would be totally re-imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table below illustrates how the task of writing a story can be
      modified by incorporating and progressively re-imagining the task.
