    <h2>Finding talent</h2>

    <p>Our reputation and environment makes it relatively easy to approach public service talent. Finding talent who trust you with their thoughts and feelings will take some work. Here are some helpful tactics:</p>

    <h4>Classrooms: </h4>
    <p>Speak with instructors before a class to watch for talent with expertise in a field and who might be comfortable sharing their thoughts on-camera.</p>

    <h4>Testimonials:</h4>
    <p> Class participants may openly come forward with positive feedback to share about a course they just took. They may be open to appearing on film to share this feedback immediately.</p>

    <h4>events: </h4>
    <p>Speak with attendees and speakers with competence in a field with a motivation to help others with similar interests.</p>

    <h4>Social Media: </h4>
    <p>Look for users who appear open to sharing their thoughts and be interested in building a learning-friendly public service.</p>

    <h4>email: </h4>
    <p>Spark general interest across all levels of a department/agency with a good question - but expect low participation through this channel. </p>

    <h4>Networking: </h4>
    <p>Reach out to your immediate public service networks and ask your colleagues to find talent leads.</p>
