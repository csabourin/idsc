      >Kaltura is an open-source video hosting platform which allows the Canada School of Public Service to upload,
      distribute, manage and track GCcampus videos within our own servers and Government of Canada network. Kaltura is also
      a cross-platform solution which creates multiple video formats for flexible viewing for our users. Uploaded videos
      can link to web pages or distance learning courses within the ecosystem, making the online learning experience more
      engaging for our learners.
