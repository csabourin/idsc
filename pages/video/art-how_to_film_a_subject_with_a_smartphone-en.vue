    <h2>How to film a subject with a smartphone</h2>

    <p>Professional video filming and editing is recommended for all CSPS video products. When professional video filming does not suit your projectâ€™s needs, videos could also be shot using a smartphone or tablet, in consultation with the Studio and with the proper approval from SCIC. Please note that all videos projects must adhere to the standard CSPS video request process as shooting a video is only one step in the process.  The post-production must still be completed by the Studio.</p>

    <p>
      Here are some important best practices which the Studio recommends you follow for non-professional videos. For additional support for your video projects, please write to <a
