    <h2>Two Minute Takeaways Video Series</h2>

    <h3>What is it?</h3>

    <p>
      The two-minute takeaway series is a collection of authentic, relevant and actionable
      insights from all levels of public servants about standout lessons they've learned on the job
      that can help other public servants improve their ability to deliver priorities and programs to
      Canadians.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a complement to CSPS' existing and forthcoming video learning ecosystem products,
      interest has been expressed in developing a scalable and flexible web video content initiative
      to support the GCcampus.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <p>
      This initiative responds to growing expectations in the public service for ongoing genuine,
      honest and insightful video interviews (with all stripes of public servants) and to create a
      base for sustainable engagement with other CSPS learning ecosystem products.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience Demand</h3>

    <p>
      Driving this initiative is the need to respond to a Government of Canada learner community
      with growing expectations for ongoing video content. It is also supported by CSPS' "birthday
      cake" model, calling for increased just-in-time video online resources to build its learning
      ecosystem for the greater benefit of the public service
    </p>

    <h3>Standards for Two Minute Takeaway videos</h3>

    <p>
      As with any online product developed at CSPS, all Two Minute Takeaway video products must
      adhere to Government of Canada standards for Web accessibility, official languages, as well as
      CSPS Branding Guidelines.
    </p>
