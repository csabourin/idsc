        <dd>All&nbsp;documents must have been edited in their source language <em>before</em> being sent for translation.</dd>
        <dt>Rejecting changes</dt>
        <dd>Recommended changes should <strong>not</strong> be rejected without discussion with the editor, who will be able to provide relevant guidance.</dd>
