<p>Below are a few guidelines on writing for the Web:</p>
    <h3>Clarity</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ensuring the material is easy to scan, read and understand</li>
        <li>making sure the first paragraph in every section is engaging and conveys the main idea clearly. This ensures that the reader can scan through the content and find what they&rsquo;re looking for quickly.</li>
        <li>keeping sentences short; breaking the information into chunks; dividing paragraphs and using bulleted lists to make the content easier to read</li>
        <li>editing to make sentences short and crisp; eliminating run-on sentences and unnecessary words</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Consistency</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ensuring the pages all use the same vocabulary, language style, verb tenses, pronouns, etc.</li>
        <li>speaking directly to the audience and using an active voice as much as possible
            <ul>
                <li>Participants will learn how to apply the principles of project management to&hellip;</li>
                <li>edit: Learn how to apply the principles of project management to&hellip;

                        <li>using plain and simple language</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This program will equip public servants with the learning tools and techniques needed to ...</li>
                <li>edit: This program gives you the information and tools you need to&hellip;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tone</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>noticing how the way we structure our sentences and the words we use create different impressions
            <ul>
                <li>Choose from these courses to learn how to target your message and deliver brief and effective requests and recommendations &hellip;</li>
                <li>edit: Learn how to focus on your audience to craft concise and effective messages. These courses help you design and deliver your message with confidence.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>ensuring the content is in a consistent tone of voice</li>
        <li>using a conversational style to engage our audience; we want to draw them in with meaningful headings and make them want to read more about all the great courses offered by the School</li>
        <li>using language that feels upbeat and positive; we want our audience to feel enthusiastic about learning through the School and feel that they can benefit from taking a course or program</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Note that texts will also be copy edited to ensure correct spelling, grammar and format.</li>
