<h2>Tips for Writing for the Web</h2>
        <p>Writing for the Web is not the same as writing for a publication because people do not read on the Web the same way they read from paper. In fact, reading from a computer screen takes more time than reading from paper. Reading complicated information on a mobile device is even more difficult because of the small screen. Also, readers of Web content scan rather than read a text.<br>
        Consequently, the key to keep readers on your web pages is to write shorter content and to focus on essential content. Here are some tips, best practices and guidelines that will help you to write more effectively for the Web.</p>
