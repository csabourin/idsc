<h2>What is Drupal?</h2>
<p><img src="~/assets/drupal/drupal_logo.png" width="170" height="179" alt="Drupal Logo" class="float-left"/>Drupal is an open source component of the CSPS learning ecosystem. It is  essentially a content management system (CMS) which allows programmers to  create Web pages within GCcampus, using a styled theme for consistency in look  and feel. The types of content which can be included in these pages are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>links</li>
    <li>images</li>
    <li>light boxes</li>
    <li>collapsible boxes</li>
    <li>videos</li>
</ul>
<h3>How is Drupal used within the ecosystem?</h3>
<p>Drupal pages are  typically used as gateways to access course registration or other online  components within the ecosystem such as self-paced courses in ILMS and videos  in Kaltura. A Drupal page can therefore be used to provide learners with learning  paths beyond ILMS and to provide direct launch of a self-paced course. It can  also be used to provide topic-related information or to showcase courses or  videos. </p>
<p>When programs onboard  to the learning ecosystem, they will have the opportunity to identify their  needs within GCcampus and work with a usability expert and graphic designer to  design the look and feel of their pages. Depending on business requirements and  IT capacity, some additional functionalities may be added within the Drupal  CMS.</p>
