          <ul>
            <li>
              Meetings are, essentially, discussion or information-only sessions. The audience can be large (10–200
              participants).
            </li>
            <li>Provide paper materials (if required) in advance. Keep the sessions under an hour.</li>
            <li>Offer multiple deliveries so that people can attend at their "convenience."</li>
            <li>
              Assessments or evaluations are not necessary since the primary purpose of a webinar is to transmit
              information; if you choose to evaluate a webinar, it should be done at Level 1 only.

          <h4>extra Tips on event Type</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the advantages of a synchronous classroom is that it is relatively easy to involve a subject
              matter expert (SMe), co-presenters or panels of experts during virtual presentations in an event. The
              entire session may revolve around an expert or they may be a small part of an overall lesson/course. Keep
              participant attendance to 15 or less so that people have the opportunity to interact with the SMe,
              co-presenters or panel of experts, or, if you wish to deliver to a larger group, manage questions through
              chat during the session or email in advance (in this way the session moderator will choose which questions
              to address and will act more as a host, saying, "Thank you, expert, let's move to our next question…). The
              audience can be 10 to more people.
            </li>
            <li>
              A good rule of thumb is that the expert should plan on preparing content that fills 50% of the
              scheduled event time. For example, a 60-minute event should contain 30 minutes of lecture and 30 minutes
              should be allocated for introduction, questions, discussions, and collaboration. If the session is one
              hour, you may want to stop for Q&amp;A at the half-way point and again just before the end; if the session
              is 45 minutes or less, you may hold questions until the end.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assessments or evaluations are not necessary since the primary purpose of an expert Q&amp;A is to
              gather information from said expert. If you choose to evaluate an expert Q&amp;A session, it would
              primarily be in order to evaluate the presenter's ability to speak with authority and credibility on the
              subject (Level 1).

          <ul>
            <li>
              If participants need to learn new information essential to their job, or if they need to be able to do
              something new at the end of the session, you are designing training. Training is characterized by
              collaborative interactions among participants, some type of assessment, and potentially work that needs to
              be completed before and after the live event(s) takes place.
            </li>
            <li>
              Training may be done in one session, but you will frequently find that an effective training program
              requires multiple sessions with "intersession work" as part of the mix (intersession work will require the
              trainer to conduct "administrative" tasks such as making sure assignments are done and answering questions
              from participants between sessions).
            </li>
            <li>
              Training classes can range from 1–2 hours; <em>never</em> more than two. If a two-hour session is
              planned, a short, 10-minute break should be placed in the middle of the session.
            </li>
            <li>
              This type of delivery is the least passive for the participants (compared with the other two) and needs
              to be designed quite purposefully to ensure that the correct knowledge/skill is transmitted and that the
              sessions are interactive enough to hold people's attention for a long period of time. Training programs
              always require leader guides and participant materials/workbooks.
            </li>
            <li>Class size should not be more than 15 participants.</li>
            <li>
              Assessments or evaluations can be conducted at Level 1 and 2; Level 3 evaluations can be conducted
              off-line via managers or online via a follow-up session where participants are asked to explain how they've
              used what they learned and discuss what problems they've encountered.
            </li>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> It is recommended that you have a Technical Support person/producer available online
      during deliveries to help with any issues that may arise. If a dedicated tech-support person is not available for
      the entire session, having one during the first 10–15 minutes is essential.
