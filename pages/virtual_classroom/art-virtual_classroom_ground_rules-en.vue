    <h2>Virtual Classroom Ground Rules</h2>

    <p>
      The virtual classroom facilitator should set the ground rules for their
      course verbally at the beginning of their course and/or use a slide to
      communicate them clearly. Ground rules help participants feel more
      comfortable and open to participation as they better understand what is
      expected of them and what they can expect from the facilitator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are some virtual classroom ground rule suggestions that can be
      included on a slide at the beginning of a course. Please note, a maximum of
      5 ground rules per slide is best for design purposes.
    </p>

    <ul class="lst-spcd">
      <li>Respect the views of others</li>

      <li>Participate actively</li>

      <li>
        Turn off all distractions (phones, cells, instant messaging and any
        software you do not need to use during the session)
      </li>

      <li>Put yourself on "MUTe" to minimize background noise</li>

      <li>Be prepared to be called on by name by the facilitator</li>

      <li>
        Use the "raise your hand" feature if you have an immediate question
        or comment or use chat.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you need to step away from the session, please use the coffee
        cup icon.
      </li>

      <li>
        Don't worry too much about typing errors and spelling, as long as
        you can be understood.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use emoticons(emotion icons) to indicate your feelings, such as the
        ubiquitous smiley face <span class="fa fa-smile-o" />
      </li>
    </ul>
