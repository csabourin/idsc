        <h3><a target="_blank" />Typical Scenarios</h3>
        <h4>
          example&nbsp;1</h3>
          <dt>Facilitator:</dt>
          <dd>Hello, Jonathan, can you hear me? I see you are logged into the classroom.</dd>
          <dd>NO SOUND/INFO FROM JONATHAN but name appears in participant box.</dd>
          <dt>Facilitator:</dt>
          <dd>
            <ol>
              <li>Points to Audio slide (with pointer/blue arrow&nbsp;&ndash; Whiteboard tools)</li>
              <li>Writes &ldquo;Call in Jonathan&rdquo; on Whiteboard and uses arrows to point to where they should call in. Have the PowerPoint open to copy and paste the 3â€‘step instructions from the audio slide into the chat.</li>
            </ol>
          </dd><dd>
            <p><em>Facilitator finally sees telephone handset next to Jonathan's name.</em></p>
          </dd><dt>Facilitator:</dt>
          <dd>Hi Jonathan, I see you have dialed in because there is a handset next to your name in the participant box which is found in the upper right-hand corner of your screen. Can you please say hello, so we can hear you?</dd>
          <dd>NO SOUND/INFO FROM JONATHAN</dd>
          <dt>Facilitator:</dt>
          <dd>Let me know by using chat if you can hear me Jonathan. We want to make sure your audio is working so we can all start together.</dd>
          <dd>NO SOUND/INFO FROM JONATHAN</dd>
          <dt>Facilitator/producer:</dt>
          <dd><em>Can also type into chat:</em> please say hello Jonathan.</dd>
          <p><em>We finally hear Jonathan say: Can you hear me? Can you hear me?</em></p>
          <p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> Yes, we can hear you please say a few words.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Your may have to resort to Producer calling participant on a 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;line to walk the participant through the process.</p>
          <h4>example&nbsp;2</h4>
          <p>Participant Is Dialed In as a &ldquo;call-in user&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Facilitator tells the participant to log out of the classroom and dial back in. It is important that the participant's name is linked to audio (especially for breakouts)</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> In GTS Meeting Centre, all callers will be a call-in-user.</p>
          <p>Calling the Participant</p>
          <p>Tell the participant the following and follow along on your screen to provide step-by-step instructions and include technical directions.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Type only csps-efpc.webex.com into your address bar.</li>
            <li>You will see the main WebEx page. Find the title of course and on the far right you will see JOIN. Click join.</li>
            <li>In the new window, on the far right, type in your name, email and password (Provide password).</li>
            <li>Participant may say nothing is working, remind them to accept the Active&nbsp;X toolbar (yellow bar across the top of their screen). Tell them to be patient.</li>
            <li>Once you see the participant has logged in, (their name will appear in the participant box) do not hang up yet, but explain how they will dial into the classroom.</li>
            <li>Use the Whiteboard tools to point to audio slide, and explain how they can dial in. Make sure they understand before you hang up so the participant can join you in class.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>example&nbsp;3</h4>
          <p>You Have a Participant on the Phone but Not in the Class</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Tell them to find the email and follow the instructions to first log into class and then dial in. Tell them they will have to hang up to do this.</li>
            <li>If #1 doesn't work you may suggest that you can call them to give them step-by-step directions to log in.</li>
          </ol>
