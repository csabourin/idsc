    <h2>Virtual facilitation best practices</h2>

    <p>
      If you have experience facilitating in a traditional classroom, you will be
      glad to know that many of the skills can be transferred to the virtual
      environment. Here are a few best practices to keep in mind:
    </p>

    <h3>&ldquo;Break the screen&rdquo;</h3>

    <p>
      Instructors like to break the ice the first few minutes of a course, but in
      the virtual world, &ldquo;breaking the screen&rdquo; is also important early on
      in your virtual session. One of the biggest mistakes you can make as a virtual
      facilitator is to talk to your computer screen. On the other side of your
      screen are real people &ndash; never forget that. Connect with your audience!
      Just because you can&rsquo;t see them, does not mean that you cannot move
      beyond the screen and make a connection. Crack a joke (an appropriate one), get
      to know participant names and expertise, share stories, be open, honest and
      very respectful.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you manage to break though the screen, you will notice a higher
      participation rate, engaging discussions and motivated learning during your
      sessions. Guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h3>Time flies</h3>

    <p>
      Time really does fly by quickly in the virtual world. Be sure to start on
      time and end on time and keep an eye on your activity timing throughout the
      session so that you don&rsquo;t run out of time on your final slides. Your
      participants may ask very pertinent questions or may start up an interesting
      discussion during your sessions. If you see value in allotting more time than
      what was planned on a particular topic, feel free to do so, but it is a good
      idea to know in advance what content is optional in case you need to make a
      quick decision on content to trim away from the session due to lack of
      time.
    </p>

    <h3>Voice matters</h3>

    <p>
      Think back to a boring, monotonous teacher from your past (we all have one)
      and how easy it was to zone out and escape that class. How motivated did you
      feel? How much did you actually learn and retain from that teacher? Don&rsquo;t
      be that teacher!
    </p>

    <p>
      Your voice is an important tool in the traditional classroom and this
      applies tenfold in a virtual classroom. Your audience has two main stimulators:
      their screen and your voice.&nbsp; Show your enthusiasm, your passion, your
      confidence and your smile through your voice. Accentuate intonations, speak up,
      be expressive, and maintain a good pace. Ask your producer to let you know
      privately if there&rsquo;s an energy drop in your voice during the session. Try
      standing up on occasion, using hand gestures when you speak, stretching
      regularly - whatever works for you.
    </p>

    <h3>&ldquo;See&rdquo; your audience</h3>

    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges in the virtual classroom for many instructors
      is the lack of non-verbal cues. How do I know if someone is checking their
      email or zoning out during my session? How do I know if they understand my
      content if I can&rsquo;t read it in their eyes?
    </p>

    <p>
      There are ways to &ldquo;see&rdquo; your audience without non-verbal cues of
      the traditional classroom.&nbsp; Generally speaking, low participation is a big
      indicator that your participants aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;with you&rdquo;. Slow
      response times can (on occasion) also be an indicator of absent
      participants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep a good pace of interaction, call on participants by name and create
      some accountability during your sessions to help you keep a pulse on your
      audience.
    </p>

    <h3>Know how to control your jitters</h3>

    <p>
      We have all felt butterflies before delivering presentation or course
      before. You will likely feel those same jitters before your first few virtual
      sessions as well. It&rsquo;s normal when you move to a new teaching
      environment, when the technology is new and when your audience is distant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news is your audience cannot see your sweaty palms and blushing
      cheeks. You have your notes to help you through memory lapses and time
      management. The only true sign of jitters that your virtual audience can
      &ldquo;see&rdquo; is your trembling or cracking voice. Increase your confidence
      by rehearsing your content and knowing your new virtual environment as best you
      can. Be forthcoming about being a WebEx newbie, let your producer support you
      and try to have fun. If you aren&rsquo;t, THeY aren&rsquo;t!
    </p>

    <h3>Stick to the need-to-know</h3>

    <p>
      Instructional design principles for the virtual classroom involves, among
      others, eliminating the fluff or the nice-to-knows and sticking to the
      essential content while leaving ample room for participant-centered
      interaction. Keep information extremely pertinent and avoid extensive rambling
      or long lectures whenever possible.
    </p>

    <h3>Interact, interact, interact</h3>

    <p>
      Another important virtual facilitation principle involves the need for
      regular interaction for effective virtual training. In fact, your sessions
      should include interaction every 3-5 minutes&hellip;at least. An interaction
      can be as simple as agreeing or disagreeing using the checkmark or X tools,
      popping an answer into chat, raising a hand to answer verbally, or jotting an
      answer down on a whiteboard. It can be a longer activity such as answering a
      poll, collaborating in sub-group breakout sessions or doing a web browsing
      exercise. Keep your participants busy and engaged by using these various tools
      throughout your sessions. It is one of many ways that will help you battle the
      email urge that your participants may experience during virtual sessions.
    </p>

    <h3>The annotations tools cost 0$</h3>

    <p>
      At the top of the WebEx interface, you will find annotation tools which you
      can use as often as you like at no extra charge&hellip;use them! Animate your
      slides and motivate your participants to follow along by pointing to a speaking
      point using the pointer tool. Underline or highlight great answers on the
      whiteboard. Draw a diagram to accompany your explanations using the shape
      tools. Use every opportunity you can to bring your slides to life and avoid the
      infamous death-by-PowerPoint.
    </p>

    <h3>Always accompany the what with the how</h3>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Click on the pencil tool.&rdquo; Hmmm&hellip; what pencil tool? As
      you use WebEx more and more, you will become increasingly comfortable with its
      tools and functionalities and you will have no trouble finding that pencil tool
      at the top of your screen&hellip;.but your participants will not all be so
      familiar with those tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you ask a question, start an activity, seek confirmation&hellip; never
      forget to accompany your question or instructions with technical direction.
      &ldquo;Click on the pencil tool at the top left of the screen.&rdquo; Sounds
      simple enough, yes, but all too often inexperienced virtual instructors forget
      to accompany the what with the how, which results in participants feeling lost,
      incompetent, frustrated and disengaged.&nbsp; Never leave anyone in the
      dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same goes for how to answer questions. If you ask a question and forget
      to instruct your participants on how to answer, one of two things will happen:
      dead silence or total chaos. Do you expect a verbal answer? Should they raise
      their hand, answer via chat, use a green checkmark or red X, or jot their
      answer on the whiteboard? If you do not tell them how to answer, they simply
      won&rsquo;t or they will answer using different tools making the answers hard
      to manage.
    </p>

    <h3>Wait for answers</h3>

    <p>
      even if you did accompany your question with technical direction,
      don&rsquo;t always expect that answers to be instantaneous. Your participants
      not only need to process your question and locate the right functionality, they
      also need time to reflect on their answer (and sometimes type it!). A few
      seconds can seem like eternity in the virtual world so resist the urge to
      assume that no one knows or to jump in with an answer too soon. Wait, embrace
      the moment of silence, and the answers will come. If they do not, consider
      rephrasing your question or calling on a participant.
    </p>

    <h3>Create trust &ndash; don&rsquo;t expect it</h3>

    <p>
      Your participants are all adults and adults like to feel respected,
      appreciated and contributing. They do not like to be put on the spot or made to
      feel incompetent. Thank your volunteers, hand out virtual high fives, ask the
      experts, be the guide on the side. Remember that they can&rsquo;t see you
      either and that can make them feel more reserved or uncomfortable. Make your
      virtual classroom a &ldquo;safe place&rdquo; for participation and opinions.
      The earlier on in your session that you are able to display this, the more your
      participants will invest in your session and participate actively.
    </p>

    <h3>Never neglect breaks</h3>

    <p>
      All sessions that run beyond 1.5 hours should include a 10 minute break
      halfway through the session. Never neglect a break even if participants ask you
      to finish early. Remaining seated in front of a computer screen for too long
      impacts participation and information retention rates, making your training
      less effective. encourage participants to walk away from the computer screen
      and stretch during the break. You too should also take a few moments to rest
      your eyes, stretch your body and refill your glass of water in order to
      continue your session with regained energy.
    </p>

    <h3>Don&rsquo;t blame the technology</h3>

    <p>
      When something goes wrong in the virtual classroom, all too often people are
      quick to blame the technology instead of trying to understand what went wrong
      and why. WebEx is a very stable platform and technical problems that can be
      attributed solely to WebEx seldom occur. When you run into technical hiccups,
      do your best to resolve the issue quickly or request help from your producer.
      After your course, remain online with your producer to debrief on any technical
      aspects that you do not quite understand. Most often issues that arise can be
      attributed to an option that was not enabled, unclear instructions which were
      provided by the facilitator or producer or an unclear understanding on how to
      use a tool.
    </p>

    <h3>Keep your cool</h3>

    <p>
      You will run into the occasional glitch during your sessions &ndash; that is
      simply a risk we must accept when we use technology. That being said, glitches
      are usually minimal and can be resolved rather quickly. The golden rule to
      remember is to keep your cool. Don&rsquo;t panic, control the anxiety in your
      voice, keep your group&rsquo;s stress-level to a minimum and focus on how best
      to get everyone on track as quickly as possible. If the issue only involves a
      single participant, ask your producer to lend assistance using private chat
      while you continue your session.
