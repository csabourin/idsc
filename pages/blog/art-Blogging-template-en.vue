        Step 1: Identify Your Audience and the Purpose of the Blog Post
      </summary>Who are you writing this blog post for? What is the purpose of the blog post? What kind of blog post
      are your writing? (a How-to Blog, A List Blog, a Curated Content Blog)
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Step 2: Identify The Key Takeaway
      </summary>What do you want your audience to know after reading your blog post?

      <summary>
        Step 3: Brainstorm a Few Possible Titles
      </summary>You don't have to pick the perfect title before your blog post is done, but it helps to jot down a
      few ideas to help keep you focused during the writing process. Choose a working title - a title that you can
      "work" with that guides your post, and helps you stay focused. Once the post is complete, you can fine tune the
      title to reflect the post content, and grab potential readers' attention.

      <p>
        Use the space below to craft a few possible blog post titles, and then choose one as your working title.
        Don't worry about finalizing your title until you're done writing. Return to this step after you have finalized
        your post to select and refine a final title.

        Step 4: Create an Outline
      </summary>

      <h5>The typical blog post consists of:</h5>An introduction: Sets the stage for what you plan to teach your
      readers how to do. A body: explains the key points of the blog post. A conclusion: Wraps up your post with a
      brief statement that's reflective of what your readers just learned.

        Step 5:Write the Introduction, the Body and the Conclusion
      </summary>

      <h5>Write the Introduction</h5>When writing your introduction, you want to keep one question top of mind: How
      can I establish credibility and empathize with my audience to introduce my topic? Feel free to leave the
      introduction for last, too. Sometimes it's easier to introduce your post after you've written the main content.
      Use the following outline to write your introduction in the right hand space.

      <h5>Steps to Writing Your Introduction</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Write a compelling opening that empathizes with the reader on a problem or difficulty.</li>

        <li>explain the problem/issue or topic in further detail.</li>

        <li>
          explain how you'll address the problem by teaching the reader how to do something, or how to find
          information on a topic.
        </li>

        <li>Transition into the body where you'll elaborate on the topic in more detail.</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Write the Body</h5>Remember, the body follows through on what you promised in the introduction. Your body
      can be written in paragraphs, with bullets, numbered lists, multiple headings, or a mix of all of these. You
      can make use of whichever format is easiest for you. Just be cognizant of this question: What are all the main
      points I need to include in order to avoid confusion, and can I add any visuals that will make learning easier
      for my readers?

      <h5>Steps to Writing Your Body</h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Write a heading that will indicate to readers you're getting into the meat of your post.</li>

        <li>
          Outline the main points in your topic. Transition from one step to the other by using words like
          "after," "next," and "then."
        </li>

        <li>Transition into the conclusion.</li>
      </ol>

      <h5>Write the Conclusion</h5>Your conclusion is where you'll paraphrase the key takeaway you outlined earlier
      in the planning stages and/or prompt your reader with a question. Steps to Writing Your Conclusion

      <ol>
        <li>Let the reader know they've arrived at the end of instruction.</li>

        <li>Summarize what the reader learned or how they benefited from reading your post.</li>

        <li>
          Ask a question to encourage the reader to leave a comment or react if the blog format has a Comment
          field.
        </li>

        <li>
          What do you want readers to do after they've read your blog post?<br>
          Do you want your readers to sign up for a course?<br>
          Request more information?<br>
          Use suggested resources?<br>
          Participate in a Discussion Forum?<br>
          Download something?<br>
          Post a comment?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>
        Step 6: Format your content
      </summary>Now that you've gone through the exercise of outlining and writing your blog post, you want to
      prepare it for publishing. Now's the time to make your blog post scannable by using headings, bold text for key
      points, insert hyperlinks, and images/videos where applicable.

    <details>
      <summary>
        Step 7: edit, edit, edit!
      </summary>everyone can use a second set of eyes to look over their post before publishing it, so have a
      colleague look it over.
