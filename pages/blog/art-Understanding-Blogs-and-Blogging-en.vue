    <p>Blog posts are posted in the blog by the <strong>blogger</strong> who created the blog. The blogger is usually someone with subject matter expertise in a subject area or a particular interest in a theme or issue. each blog post becomes like an entry in a journal, accessible over a period of time. Blog posts may be active for several months or longer. A blogger can choose to post at intervals of his or her choosing, such as once a week, or once a month or several times a year. A successful blogger attracts a community of learners who repeatedly return to a blog to investigate the latest postings. Often the blog also provides a Comment area where users are encouraged to leave Comments. This approach helps to build and support a community of practice.</p>
