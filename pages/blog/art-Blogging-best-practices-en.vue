    <h2>Blogging Best Practices</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Have a clear objective: What are my blogging goals? What am I trying to accomplish? Why am I blogging?</li>

      <li>
        How much do I already know about the topic, and how much will I have to research? The answers to these
        questions affect the time you are prepared to invest. You also have to consider that what your writing is
        &quot;out there&quot; and anyone can criticize or call you out on something. Preparation is key.
      </li>

      <li>
        Notion of storytelling (address your readers directly, among others), infotainment almost. This means using
        the first person (&quot;I&quot;).
      </li>

      <li>
        What do you want your readers to do after (call to action): comment? Register? Read more? Or end with a
        question, to encourage reflection.
      </li>

      <li>Plain language - don't write a typical government document. No one wants to read that.</li>

      <li>Professional but Informal (eg, use &quot;didn't&quot; instead of &quot;did not&quot;).</li>

      <li>
        Blog upside down - people who read blogs are starved for time and are impatient. You have to give them the
        punchline first, then the who, what, when, where and why.
      </li>

      <li>
        How are you going to respond to comments? If you don't respond, it's not a blog. It's a one-way, top-down
        communication. It's called a newsletter. Carve time every day, or every other day to answer comments.
      </li>

      <li>Rules have to be clear of what language will not be tolerated.</li>

      <li>Length. Better write a series of 4 x 500-word blogs on a topic than a unique 2000-word post.</li>

      <li>
        Frequency. If you don't publish regularly, readers will forget about you. Commit to once a month (at the
        very least) and stick to it.
      </li>

      <li>
        Have the courage to be imperfect - the best bloggers are real human. Less cautious than the average
        author.
      </li>
