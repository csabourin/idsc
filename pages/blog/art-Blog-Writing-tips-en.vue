            <h5>Write with direction.</h5>

            <p>
              When I sit down to write, I make sure that I know where I'm going with my words and how I intend
              to get there. When editing, I consider cutting unproductive content that does not move the reader
              in the correct direction.
            </p>

          <li>
            <h5>Avoid over-simplification.</h5>

              Text gets straight to the point
            </aside>

            <p>
              I remember to have faith in my readers and I resist the temptation to dumb things down.
              Accessibility is largely about framing. When editing, I adjust content with a view to greater
              clarity and concision, which will give the intricacies of my writing more space to shine.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Leave things out.</h5>

            <p>
              We must also have faith in our readers' capacity to reason. When writing, don't be afraid to
              give your readers space to ask questions of both the content and of themselves. When editing, I
              remove anything that seems to be flogging a dead horse.

              Subheadings and numbered lists reduce eye fatigue and make the text easy to follow

          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Get creative.</h5>

            <p>
              When writing, don't be afraid to experiment, to play with sentence structure, to be a bit
              unconventional. When editing, I keep an eye out for repetition and consider how I can inject a bit
              of variety into my language.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Use line breaks.</h5>

            <p>
              Material for readers should not contain dense blocks of text because it is more difficult to
              read on the internet. This is particularly true when it comes to reading on a mobile device. When
              writing, I keep my paragraphs short and break up lists. During my editorial phase, I pay attention
              to my most important sentences and consider using line breaks for emphasis instead of formatting
              like bold text and underlining.
            </p>

              Short, structured paragraphs make for easy reading
            </aside>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Don't shy away from yourself.</h5>

            <p>
              When writing, I don't bother tempering my intensity if I'm writing about something that is
              important to me. When editing, I also keep an eye peeled for unnecessary equivocating and
              passion-killing caveats.
