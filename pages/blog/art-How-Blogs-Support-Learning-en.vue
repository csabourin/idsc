    <h2>How Blogs Support Learning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The blogs at CSPS serve three main goals: to enhance and extend the learning experience provided in the
        classroom and online, to promote the various course offerings at CSPS and help build a community of
        learners.
      </li>

      <li>
        Blogging enhances learning by connecting public servants to knowledge on an ongoing basis, reaching beyond
        what they receive in the classroom or in their e-learning materials. Blogs enable students to easily follow the
        news and updates of their instructors, thereby staying in the loop and continuing to develop their
        knowledge.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bloggers can share questions or inquiries raised by students after courses are complete and enable students
        to benefit from discussions that take place in future iterations of the courses they take.
      </li>

      <li>
        Blogs are also a great way to promote classes at CSPS because they showcase not only the wide range of
        available courses, but also the diversity of voices and expertise available in our instructors and
        faculty.
      </li>

      <li>
        Blogs can also be more personal, providing invaluable personal experience of a subject matter expert about
        a topic or theme.
      </li>

      <li>
        In many functional areas, ongoing changes to policy or issues arise that cannot be addressed quickly in
        other learning delivery modes. A blog provides a vehicle for timely access to subject matter expertise.
      </li>

      <li>
        Blogs can also be used to promote programs, and to direct learners to other sources of information and
        learning opportunities.
      </li>

      <li>
        Blogs used in conjunction with Comment fields or Discuss Forums help to build and support a community of
        learners who are also interested in the same themes or subject areas.
      </li>

      <li>
        Blogs which include links to other sources of information help the learner develop an online network of
        resources that can be consulted regularly. This helps the learner to develop breadth of understanding on a
        theme or subject area.
