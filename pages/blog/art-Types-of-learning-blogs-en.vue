    <h2>Types of learning blogs</h2>
    <p>There are three main types of blogs that are written specifically to support learning.</p>
    <h4>How-To-Blog</h4>
    <p>
      A &quot;how to&quot; blog post does exactly what it describes: it teaches the reader how to do something by
      breaking down a series of steps. &quot;How-to&quot; posts attract readers because we want to learn how to do
      something. The Blog post may teach the reader How-to evaluate Social Workplace Learning or How-to Monitor
      Discussion Forums.
    </p>
    <h4>List Blog</h4>
    <p>
      The list post is one of the most popular and easy-to-read blog formats. Readers love lists because they're
      scannable, so they can easily find the information they are looking for. Lists are also handy at keeping posts
      succinct. For a list post to be successful, it should be logically organized from most to least popular,
      alphabetically (if you're writing a list of resources or a glossary, for example), or step-by-step. A list blog may
      focus on the topic of 10 Ways to engage Learners in Discussion Forums or Five effective Video editing Tools
    </p>
    <h4>Curated Content Blog</h4>
    <p>
      Not all content creation has to be 100% original. Bloggers can selectively gather and share only the most
      relevant, comprehensive insights and resources from around the web for your readers. That's content
      curation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content curation serves the same purpose as content creation: to educate, engage, and attract more
      readers. Curated content blogs are valuable in order to introducing your audience to new and different
      perspectives. A curated blog post usually uses some sort of list-based format, so it's generally very easy for
      readers to consume. A curated content blog may focus on The Best Ways of Using Social Media for Learning. This blog
      would typically provide a synopsis and possible links to other online content which provides ways of using social
      media for leSarning.
