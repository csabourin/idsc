    <h2>Writing an effective Blog Post</h2>
    <p>
      Blogs flourish with writing that is sincere and human. Your blog is a place where you can develop an authentic voice and style
      of your own (your tone might be elevated or casual, dry or descriptive) but it is important to prioritize clarity, accessibility
      and directness.
    </p>
    <h5>Planning is Key to Success</h5>
    <p>
      There are certain steps you can follow to make sure your blog and blog posts have the essential components necessary to perform
      well. The following 10 steps will help you be a successful blogger. You may wish to use the Blogging Template Job Aid to help you
      plan and organize your blog post.

    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 1: Understand your audience</strong> </summary>
      <p>
        Before you start to write, have a clear understanding of your audience. What do they want to know about? What will resonate
        with them? If your blog is part of a learning program, what prior learning are you supporting? What new knowledge are you
        providing?
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 2: Start with a goal, a topic and a working title</strong> </summary>
      <p>
        Be clear on the goal of your blog. Then, you need to pick a specific topic for your blog post. The topic can be general, but
        it is essential to come up with a few topic ideas to get you started. After you choose one, you need to create a working title.
        Here are a few suggestions for crafting magnetic headlines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Address the reader directly</li>
        <li>Ask a question</li>
        <li>State what the text will provide</li>
        <li>Keep your title short (7 words or less)</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 3: Organize your content</strong> </summary>
      <p>
        Sometimes blog posts can have an overwhelming amount of information. Organize the information so readers are not intimidated
        by the length or amount of content. The organization can take multiple forms - sections, lists, tips. To complete this step,
        outline your post. That way, before you start writing, you know which points you want to cover, and the best order in which to
        do it.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 4: Write the content</strong> </summary>
      <p>
        The next step is actually writing the content. Once you have your outline, you're ready to fill in the blanks. Use your
        outline as the guide and be sure to expand on all of your points as needed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Write about what you feel comfortable writing about, and do additional research, if necessary, to gather more
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't forget that many people will be reading your blog posts on a smartphone or tablet. Be sure to put your most
          important information first. Sentences should be concise and paragraphs kept short, as they will appear much longer when
          condensed on a small screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          First, grab the reader's attention. If you lose the reader in the first sentences of the introduction, they will stop
          reading even though they haven't given your post a fair chance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The reader is looking for relevancy. You should explain why your post is important. You can use stories, data, or talk
          through best practices. The reader is looking for context to give relevancy to the blog post.
        </li>
        <li>Remember to attribute sources to any facts, data or research information you use in your blog.</li>
        <li>
          Use a writing style matched to web behaviours. The CSPS Writing Guidelines for e-Learning Products provides support to
          help you write effectively for your web audience. This Guide provides valuable information about understanding the web
          behaviours of your audience, (in particular why and how web users scan rather than read) and how to create user-friendly
          web content.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p />
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 5: Pick a catchy, informative title</strong> </summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with your working title.</li>
        <li>
          As you start to edit your title, keep in mind that it's important to keep the title accurate and clear and
          informative.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, work on making your title compelling- whether it's through strong language, alliteration, or another literary
          tactic to motivate your reader to open the blog post.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, see if you can shorten it up at all. No one likes a long, overwhelming title.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 6: enhance the content</strong> </summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider sub-headings where appropriate to support scanning behaviours of web users.</li>
        <li>
          See if there is any data or statistics to back up some of the claims you made in your post but remember to attribute
          the sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider links to additional resources or information.
          <p>
            Hyperlinks are a great way to share additional information with your readers or include in-text citations and
            accreditation. If you have multiple blog posts pertaining to related topics, hyperlinks are a great way to get your
            reader to see more of your content by linking to other posts. However, when you include a hyperlink in the middle of
            your text, there is the risk that your reader will leave your post and not return.
          </p>
          Consider these best practices for
          hyperlinking:
          <ul>
            <li>Do not include more than 3 hyperlinks in a body of text</li>
            <li>If possible, list relevant and related links at the end of the text</li>
            <li>embed or quote the relevant sections of other content under discussion, rather than simply linking to it</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Including images in your blog posts is a great way to enhance and illustrate your arguments.</li>
        <li>
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              However, be sure to avoid clip art and generic images that don't add value to the post, as readers will ignore
              these or find them annoying.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember to keep copyright considerations in mind. It is important to cite the sources of any images you use,
              and to abide by the appropriate rules for republication of images you do not own. Consider browsing Wikimedia
              Commons or the Creative Commons gallery on Flickr to find free-to-use images for your blog posts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 7: edit, edit, edit</strong> </summary>
      <p>
        Probably the most important step in creating an effective blog post is having the discipline to edit and edit again until
        the blog post is as concise, clear and organized as it can be.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 8: Check and peer review</strong> </summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Blogging Checklist Job Aid as a self-check.</li>
        <li>Ask a colleague to review your blog post before you post it.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 9: Translating/Publishing/Posting Your Blog</strong> </summary>
      <p>
        You will need to request a blogging account. Then once you have planned and written a draft of your blog and reviewed the
        blog post with the Blog Checklist, the blog post should be translated and the CSPS posting process should be used.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary> <strong>Step 10: Keep the Blog Alive</strong> </summary>
      <p>
        each blog post you publish has a comment section below it, where readers -students and colleagues- can ask questions and
        engage with the content of your writing. Just like a classroom discussion, your readers have the opportunity to contribute and
        enhance the overall learning experience. All writing in a comment section (including your own authorial responses) does not
        require translation and may be posted in an individual's language of choice. Individuals (not the blog author) are responsible
        for the content of the comments they post.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Timely Responses</em> While you are expected to monitor comments (either through email alerts or visiting the blog post
        page) every few days throughout the week following the publication of a post, it is worth noting that immediate, responses are
        not necessarily required. Feel free to simply acknowledge the comment and revisit it later on if you are very busy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like in the classroom, sometimes commenters will engage in a discussion with each other; and just like the classroom,
        you do not need to interject at every statement.
      </p>
    </details>
    <h5>Staying on Topic</h5>
    <p>
      Should a commenter derail the discussion away from the subject at hand, feel free to gently direct your
      commenters to stay on topic. Similarly to moderating classroom discussions, it can be helpful to record the divergent topic for
      later discussion. Comment sections can be a fruitful source of inspiration for blog posts! Simply inform the off-topic commenters
      that you intend to address the subject in a later post, and thank them for their interest.
    </p>
    <h5>Writing Follow-up Posts</h5>
    <p>
      Should you write a follow-up post based on content from a comment section, it is a good idea to open the post with a brief
      explanation and a link to the post where the original discussion occurred. Likewise, go back to the original comment section and
      post a link to your new post. Many commenters will subscribe to comment threads via email, and so even if the post is rather
      outdated, they will see that you have continued to address the topic in subsequent writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, if you are writing a series of posts on a related topic or are writing a response to a blog post by one of your
      colleagues, it is important to link to this content for the benefit of new readers.
