    <h2>Storyboarding Template</h2>
    <p>
      A storyboard is a visual layout document that indicates all the
      necessary elements of a multi-media course component, such as graphics,
      audio, video, on-screen text and any interactive features. The main purpose
      is to illustrate what you envision for your design, flow and structure of
      the course component and to ensure everyone is on the same page before
      programming begins. It also helps programmers understand the structure and
      the sequencing of your component.
