    <h2>New &ldquo;Product Specification Sheet&rdquo; replacing the LOIF</h2>
    <p>Over the next fiscal year, the LOIF will be  replaced by the Product Specification Sheet - a single source document  containing all information related to a product that will be used throughout  the product life cycle from analysis to implementation and for any subsequent  changes thereafter. </p>
    <p>The Product Specification Sheet will negate the need for the multiple forms currently being used across the School as it will consolidate all necessary information in one place and be accessible by all internal groups. </p>
    <p>Until the new process becomes official you  can continue using the <a href="../self-paced/learning_object_information_form_(loif)_process-en.html" target="_blank">LOIF  (Learning Object Information Form)</a>.</p>
    <p>
      If you have a new product in development and wish to participate in
      pilot testing for the Product Specification Sheet, please contact <a
