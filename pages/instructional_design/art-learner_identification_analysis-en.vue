    <h2>Learner Identification Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The Learner Identification Analysis Job-aid is designed to be used by Instructional Designer&rsquo;s to gather
      information about learners. The questions are used to gather information about who the learners are, where they are
      located and other general information about their working environment and set-up. The questions are intended to
      help Instructional Designer&rsquo;s understand what factors they need to consider when selecting a learning
      delivery mode for their learners.
