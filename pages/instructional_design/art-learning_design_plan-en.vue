    <h2>Learning Design Plan</h2>
    <p>
      The <em>Learning Design Plan</em> is to be completed by the instructional designers. This template is intended
      to offer a framework for the instructional design concepts of a learning product. It highlights the design
      approach, the course outline and objectives, and the overall instructional architecture. Basically, it acts as the
      blueprint for your course. By answering the questions and completing the tables in this template, you will capture
      all the key design specifications that should be included in the learning design plan. The completed template
      should be reviewed and approved by your management team and clients to ensure everyone agrees on the overall design
      approach.
