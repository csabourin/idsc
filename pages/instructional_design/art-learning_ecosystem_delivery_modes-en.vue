    <h2>Learning ecosystem Delivery Modes &nbsp;</h2>
    <p>
      Currently the School&rsquo;s learning ecosystem is represented by 8
      delivery modes, including classroom courses. It is up to the program
      designer or program design group to decide which modality or mix of
      modalities will
    </p> <ol>
      <li>enhance a learning program&rsquo;s efficiency and/or</li>
      <li>better support the learning objectives.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Remember that aspects of technology supported learning can also be
      integrated into the classroom (before, during and after). Finding an
      appropriate mix is the result of detailed analyses. Refer to analysis job
      aids in the DO section.

      Blended learning describes learning activities that involve a
      combination of face-to-face interactions and technologically-mediated
      interactions between learners, teachers and resources. It is also known as
      &lsquo;multi-mode&rsquo; or &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; instruction.
