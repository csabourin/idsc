            <h5><em>What is Copyright and how is it different from Intellectual Property (IP)?</em></h5>
            <p><img alt="intellectual property" class="float-left" src="~/assets/Copyright_FAQ-en_2.png" width="400"> There is often confusion between the terms "Copyright" and "Intellectual Property."</p>
            <p>Copyright is the sole right to produce or reproduce a work (or substantial part of it) in any form. In other words, copyright provides protection for original artistic, dramatic, musical and literary creations, so that they are not copied, performed or broadcast without permission. In Canada, all original works are protected by copyright, including books, journal articles, video recordings, websites, and computer software.</p>
            <p>Intellectual property (IP), in contrast, is a broader term that refers to the legal rights to ideas, inventions and creations in the industrial, scientific, literary and artistic fields. IP includes symbols, names, images, designs and models used in business, patents, trademarks, industrial designs, and more, all of which are legally protected under the Canadian IP system.</p>
            <p>In other words, while copyright refers to an author’s sole right to a work, intellectual property is an umbrella term that includes copyright, as well as other types of rights.</p>

            <h5><em>What are the legal rights protected by copyright?</em></h5>
            <p>The copyright holder has legally-protected economic and moral rights. The economic right gives the copyright holder the right to receive payment for use of their work, while the moral right grants the owner the right to protect how the work is used.</p>

            <h5><em>Why is copyright important to the School?</em></h5>
            <p>The School is both a <em>creator/producer</em> and <em>user</em> of copyright-protected works.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that copyright restricts the <em>unauthorized</em> use of intellectual, academic and literary creations such as books, articles, speeches, essays, tables, frameworks, illustrations and translations. For School employees who draw upon copyright-protected materials in the creation of videos, courses, learning modules, job aids, events, communication products, and more, it is critical to have an understanding of what is permitted when it comes to using or drawing inspiration from the work of others.</p>
            <p>Without the consent of the copyright owner, it is an infringement to reproduce, modify <span class="underlined">or translate</span> the work of others. Copyright gives the author of a work the right to determine how, or if, it can be used by others. School employees who use copyright-protected materials in the classroom or in creating learning products are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the <em><a href="http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Copyright Act</a></em>.</p>

            <h5><em>Who can hold copyright?</em></h5>
            <p>Generally, the author of a work is the owner of the copyright. However, in some cases, a work may be produced under a person's terms of employment. In the federal Public Service, for example, copyright belongs to the employer – the <a href="copyright_glossary-en.html#crown" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Crown</a>. The Crown is the copyright holder in instances where the work is prepared as part of an employee's duties, but may or may not be the copyright holder if the work is undertaken by a contractor (for more information contact the School’s <a href="mailto:csps.procurementapprovisionnements.efpc@canada.ca" title="This link will open a window of your email app">Procurement Team</a>).</p>

            <h5><em>How long does copyright last in Canada?</em></h5>
            <p>In Canada, copyright remains in place for the lifetime of the creator of the work, plus <em>50 years</em>.</p>
            <p>However, copyright duration varies by country. For example, in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, copyright remains in place for the lifetime of the creator of the work, plus <em>70 years</em>.</p>

            <summary />
            <h5><em>What is the public domain?</em></h5>
            <p>Public domain refers to content that can be freely copied, shared, altered and republished by anyone. Content in the public domain includes works where copyright has expired, works that are ineligible for copyright and works whose creator has waived copyright. No permission is needed to copy or use public domain works.</p>
            <p>Please note that the majority of material found on the Internet is NOT in the public domain, even though it is publically available/viewable. Public domain and publically available are not interchangeable terms. It is the user's responsibility to verify that a work is in the public domain before using it. To identify if a work produced in Canada is in the public domain, please use the <em><a href="~/assets/3.%20Public_domain_decision_tree_en.pdf" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Public Domain Decision Tree</a></em> available in the "Tools" section of this website.</p>

            <h5><em>What is Copyright infringement?</em></h5>
            <p>Infringement is the term used in the <em><a href="http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Copyright Act</a></em> to denote a breach or violation of the <em>Act</em>. Simply put, copyright infringement is the use of a protected work in a way that is not permitted by the <em><a href="http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/" target="_blank">Copyright Act</a></em>.</p>
            <p>Using a work that is protected in ways that are reserved solely for the copyright owner deprives the owner of potential financial compensation. It also deprives them of <a href="copyright_glossary-en.html#moral" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">moral rights</a> (integrity of the work) and may constitute copyright infringement, which is a prosecutorial offense.</p>
            <p>examples of copyright infringement include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Photocopying parts of a book</li>
              <li>Inserting a bibliography taken from another work (book, specialized journal, article, etc.) into course materials</li>
              <li>Reproducing tables or charts taken from a published work</li>
              <li><strong>Translating</strong> text taken from someone else's work</li>
              <li>Copying courseware</li>
              <li>Not respecting websites' "Terms of Use" when showing online material/video in class</li>
            </ul>
            <p>examples of moral rights infringement include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Using a text or a portion of a text out of context or without attribution</li>
              <li>Reproducing a cartoon</li>
              <li>Using a survey questionnaire for purposes other than those for which it was designed</li>
              <li>Transcribing a televised/or recorded interview for inclusion in course material</li>
              <li>Re-recording audio materials</li>
              <li>Modifying or adapting a course without authorization</li>

              <li>Damage to your professional credibility;</li>
              <li>Damage to the School’s reputation;</li>
              <li>A financial impact on the School if monetary damages have to be paid to the copyright holder; or</li>

            <h5><em>What is fair dealing?</em></h5>
            <p>Fair dealing is a long-standing feature of Canadian copyright law that permits certain uses of copyright material in ways that do not necessarily threaten the interests of copyright owners, but which may have significant social benefits, if they are deemed fair.</p>
            <p>The Fair Dealing clause of the <em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Copyright Act</a></em> allows users to engage in certain activities relating to research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, or news reporting. With respect to criticism, review, and news reporting, the user must mention the source of the material, along with the name of the author, performer, maker, or broadcaster for the dealing to be fair.</p>

            <h5><em>Can the School avail itself of the Fair Dealing clause in the Copyright Act for educational purposes?</em></h5>

            <dl>
              <dt>Reformulate</dt>
              <dd>Ideas, concepts and theories are not subject to copyright; only the form in which they are expressed is (language, words, graphic representation, and so on).</dd>
              <dt>Synthesize</dt>
              <dd>An independent creative effort might be sufficient to make a work original.</dd>
              <dt>Use several sources</dt>
              <dd>By drawing on a number of authors, you reduce the proportion of &quot;inspirations&quot; drawn from a single work.</dd>
              <dt>Use brief quotes</dt>
              <dd>The source (including author, title, publisher, and year of publication) must always accompany a verbatim quotation.</dd>
              <dt>Purchase</dt>
              <dd>Reduced prices might be negotiated if large quantities of a work are being purchased.</dd>
              <dt>Request authorization</dt>
              <dd>You can request authorization by phone, email, letter, etc. but it is always best to have authorization in written form.</dd>
              <dt>Request a license</dt>
              <dd>A license allows a person or organization to use a protected work in a specific manner, generally by providing a lump sum payment or by paying royalties to the owner of the copyright.</dd>
              <dt>Request an assignment of exploitation rights</dt>
              <dd>An "assignment of exploitation rights" constitutes a transfer of ownership by which the owner of the copyright assigns the ownership or use of his or her work to a person or organization.</dd>

            <h5><em>How do I get permission to reproduce copyrighted materials?</em></h5>
            <p>To use material created by others, you have to contact the author or publisher to ask for permission. You will find documents to assist with this in the <a href="templates-en.html" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window"><em>Templates</em> section</a> of this website.</p>
            <p>It is always better to have the written permission of the author before using copyrighted material. Once you have permission, you should incorporate all relevant information into the <em><a href="repository-en.html" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Copyright Repository</a></em> that has been developed for this purpose.</p>

            <h5><em>How do I get a license to use a work from a copyright owner who cannot be located?</em></h5>
            <p>In Canada, the <a href="http://www.cb-cda.gc.ca/home-accueil-e.html" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Copyright Board of Canada</a> is an economic regulatory body that is responsible for, among other things, issuing <a href="copyright_glossary-en.html#license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">licences</a> for the use of works when the copyright owner cannot be located. It will grant you a license as long as you have made every reasonable effort to find the copyright owner. You must therefore conduct a thorough search before contacting them. To start your research you may want to consult the <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/cpyrghts/dsplySrch.do?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Canadian Intellectual Property Office Copyright data base</a>.</p>
            <p>Licences granted by the Board are only valid in Canada. Outside Canada, the user is bound by the laws of each country in which the work will be used, even if the copyright owner is Canadian.</p>

            <h5><em>What is the Government of Canada Copying License?</em></h5>
            <p>In April 2016, the Government of Canada (through Public Services and Procurement Canada) signed an agreement with <em><a href="copyright_glossary-en.html#access" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Access Copyright</a></em> and <em><a href="copyright_glossary-en.html#access" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Copibec</a></em>. The <em><a href="https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/communications-licence-eng.html" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">Government of Canada Copying Licence</a></em> gives federal government employees (including consultants, temporary employees, contractors and students) authorization to copy copyrighted protected material licensed by these organizations.</p>
            <p>each organization provides access to a rich repertoire of works by thousands of Canadian and foreign authors, visual artists, and publishers in both of Canada’s official languages.

            <h5><em>Is it permissible to use content from another governmental organization? Is all content found on GC websites under Crown copyright?</em></h5>
            <p>If the material is created by a federal department/agency, then it is under Crown copyright, which means it is free to use within the federal government context. However, it is highly recommended that you contact the organization to ensure all content is in fact crown-owned and not under the control of a third-party license, which can affect the materials' usage conditions.</p>
            <p>Using provincial or municipal government works generally requires permission; however, it is unlikely that this permission will be denied or require payment. One exception is that it is permitted to copy – without permission – any amount of information from statutes, regulations and judicial decisions from all provinces and territories except Manitoba, Quebec and Nunavut.</p>
            <p>If you intend to use international governmental material, be aware that Canadian laws may not apply. It is the user's responsibility to respect the rules that apply in the country where the material originates.</p>

            <p>Basically, any material that the School creates is Crown copyrighted, so other federal public servants can use it as they wish. If, however, the material is licensed/obtained through a third party, those wishing to use it must adhere to the "Terms and Conditions" of the applicable license.</p>
            <p>For requests made to the School from non-client organizations or from individuals seeking to use material that is already publicly available, users should follow the <a href="http://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/termsandconditions/ouc-eng.aspx" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new window">School’s ownership and use of content Terms of Use</a>.</p>

            <p>Since models and theories are proprietary rights and copyright owners may be in the business of offering training and other services, it is highly unlikely that you would have permission to use copyrighted materials to structure an entire course design on a theory or model without the owners’ consent. This restriction applies even if the material is publicly available on the internet. Please note that without the author's consent, using these materials is considered infringement.</p>

            <p>"Personal use" means that the copyright holder is giving free and unlicensed use of their work for non-commercial and non-profit uses.</p>
            <p>For example, if a website's "Terms of Use" specify that you can use its material for personal use only, this means that you can make copies of the website's materials fo yourself provided that you do not distribute (which includes broadcasting in a classroom) or sell them.</p>
