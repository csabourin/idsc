    <h2>Copyright Repository</h2>
    <p>
      This repository aims to track copyrighted materials (books, articles, images, video, etc.) included in the School learning products. The goal is to gather all relevant information in a single database to effectively and efficiently monitor the licenses acquired by the School, while promoting their sharing. This information is essential to manage uniformly and centrally acquired licenses and to ensure that the use of copyrighted material is in compliance with the laws and policies in force.

    <h3>How to use the Directory</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before acquiring copyrighted material:
        <ul>
          <li>Browse the Directory (not only your team tab) to see if the material you intend to obtain has not already been acquired. If it's the case, please contact the identified point of contact to see how the existing material can be shared.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need to acquire a licence:
        <ul>
          <li>Refer to the <em><a title="This link will open in a new window" href="templates-en.html" target="_blank">Template section</a></em> of this website to access the "permission request" and the "writing agreement" templates.</li>
          <li>When an agreement is reached, save signed request and agreement on GCdocs (they have legal value and need to be preserved as such).</li>
          <li>Access your team tab in the <a title="This link will open in a new window" href="http://gcdocs/otcs/llisapi.dll/overview/10550647" target="_blank">Copyright Repository</a> and fill all boxes that apply, using the drop down menu when available.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the licence is acquired, regularly review the Repository to :
        <ul>
          <li>Add all new relevant information.</li>
          <li>Review all expiration dates, and to plan to renew agreement if needed or remove protected material from learning material if the licence is not renewed.</li>
          <li>Hide all outdated information (hide the entire column). For legal reasons, information should never be deleted.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
