    <h2>Suggested resources for copyright-free works or licenced works</h2>
    <p>
      There are a number of resources which can provide School employees with access to works that are free of rights or whose rights of use have already been granted or negotiated. These resources can be very useful as they provide quick access to a wide variety of works. However, to avoid any violation of the <em>Copyright Act</em>, it is important to respect the specific terms and conditions associated with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section provides guidance on how to uses works available through the following resources:
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>
        <h4>Public Domain</h4>
      </summary>
      <p>Works that are <em>not</em> protected by copyright are said to be in the <em><a title="This link will open in a new window" href="copyright_glossary-en.html#public" target="_blank">public domain</a></em>. That means: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the work can be used without restrictions on copying and adapting;</li>
        <li>permission is not required to use the work; and</li>
        <li>there are no legal requirement to attribute the work to its author.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A work typically enters the public domain when its copyright term expires. Works can also be in the public domain because the work was not eligible for copyright protection in the first place or because the copyright owner has forfeited any copyright in the work to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determining whether or not a work is in the public domain can be complicated, however, as the terms of copyright often differ depending on a work’s authorship, format, date of publication, and country of origin. To identify if a work produced in Canada is in the public domain, please refer to the <em><a title="This link will open in a new window" href="~/assets/3. Public_domain_decision_tree_en.pdf" target="_blank">Public Domain Decision Tree</a></em> available in the Tools section of this website.

        <h4>Open Access</h4>
      </summary>
      <p>
        Open Access materials generally allow individuals to view, download and copy the material freely for any lawful purpose. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, is to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two different terms of use for various Open Access works:
      </p>
      <table style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="col-sm-1">
              <img src="~/assets/Copyright_gratis_open_access.png" alt="Gratis Open Access" style="margin-right: 15px;">
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-3">
              Gratis Open Access
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-8">
              Refers to online access free of charge
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="col-sm-1">
              <img src="~/assets/Copyright_libre_open_access.png" alt="Libre Open Access" style="margin-right: 15px;">
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-3">
              Libre Open Access
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-8">
              Refers to online access free of charge plus some additional re-use rights (e.g. Creative Commons licences)
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        Therefore, before using any open access materials, check to see if there are any limits to the use of the content as Open Access does NOT mean “not copyrighted.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output (e.g. peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs). Most of this material can be found in online repositories, of which the two most commonly used are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Directory of Open Access Journals (<a title="This link will open in a new window" href="http://doaj.org/" target="_blank">http://doaj.org/</a>)</li>
        <li>Open Access Repositories (<a title="This link will open in a new window" href="http://www.opendoar.org/" target="_blank">http://www.opendoar.org/</a>)</li>
      </ul>

    <details>
      <summary>
        <h4>Creative Commons Material</h4>
      </summary>
      <p>
        Creative Commons is a non-profit organization dedicated to making it easier for individuals to share and build on the work of others. Just as with Open Access, the Creative Commons status does <span class="underlined">NOT</span> make the material free of rights. It provides a number of standardized licences for copyrighted content that clearly specify what type of use the creator grants to users and what rights they wish to reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creative Commons material can be used for in-class courses without requesting the written permission of the author, however users must respect the licence conditions chosen by the author. These conditions may, <em>or may not</em>, allow modifications (including translation) of the material. There are 6 types of licences which exist. To learn how to interpret these licences, please consult the <em><a title="This link will open in a new window" href="tools-en.html" target="_blank">How to interpret a Creative Commons licence</a></em> infographic available in the Tool Section of this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creative commons materials can be found in multiple ways. A good place to start is with the search portal on the <a title="This link will open in a new window" href="https://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons website</a>, which allows users to return very specific results from a number of websites which host Creative Commons material. Websites, like <a title="This link will open in a new window" href="https://www.google.ca/advanced_search?q=gj&hl=en" target="_blank">Google</a> or YouTube, also offer advanced search options which provide customizable searches for Creative Commons material. Note that these search tools are based on a search term, the type of licence the material is available under, and/or based on the type of use to be made of the material.
