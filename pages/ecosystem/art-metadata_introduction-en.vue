    <h2>CSPS Thesaurus</h2> <p>A thesaurus assists us with the comprehension of terms, such as for e.g. menu items, in two ways, namely:</p> <ol> <li>The semantics of the terms i.e., their descriptions, and</li> <li>Their relationships with other terms, including more general above and more specific below.</li> </ol> <p> The <em>Canada School of Public Service Thesaurus</em> is a bilingual thesaurus consisting of terminology which represents areas used in the information resources of CSPS. </p> <p> The <em>Canada School of Public Service Thesaurus</em> is managed and updated by <a href="http://gcdocs.csps-efpc.gc.ca/otcs/llisapi.dll?func=ll&objId=6064189&objAction=browse&sort=name" target="_blank">Metadata Stewards Working Group</a>. </p> <h3>Characteristics, content and structure</h3> <p> The <em>Canada School of Public Service Thesaurus</em> follows the guidelines used by the <em>Government of Canada Core Subject Thesaurus</em> which was developed in accordance with the <em>Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri</em> (ISO 2788-1986) and the <em>Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri</em> (ISO 5964-1985). </p> <p> The thesaurus includes <a class="wb-lbx" href="#pref">preferred terms</a> and <a class="wb-lbx" href="#non-pref" /> (synonyms). Preferred terms are linked together through hierarchical relationships (<a class="wb-lbx" href="#broad">broader term</a> and <a class="wb-lbx" href="#narrow">narrower term</a>), associative relationships (<a class="wb-lbx" href="#related">related term</a>) and inter-language equivalence relationships (english and French equivalents). </p> <a href="http://www.thesaurus.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=en&n=0594D979-1" target="_blank">Government of Canada Core Subject Thesaurus</a> <section id="pref" class="mfp-hide modal-dialog modal-content overlay-def">
