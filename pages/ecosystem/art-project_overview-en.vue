    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h4>Basic Information</h4>
    <p>The ecosystem was created in the wake of Blueprint 2020 and the launch of the Strategic Directions initiative of the Canada School of Public Service. At that time, the School committed to modernizing its programs and its learning infrastructure to contribute to the development of a high-performing public service.</p>
    <p>As part of the plan to modernize its learning infrastructure, the School designed, tested and implemented an online learning portal with the aim of reducing training costs, encouraging the use of modern smart technologies, and allowing the entire public service to share learning resources.</p>
