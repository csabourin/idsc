        <h2><abbr title="Official Languages">OL</abbr> Guidelines for GCconnex and GCpedia Use</h2>
        <h3>Open Blogs/&#8203;Forums</h3>
        <p>Rules on official languages<sup><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The rules that apply to all aspects of your work also apply to GC2.0 Tools as well as to other online learning platforms used within an ecosystem like Moodle. Any document or information that you would usually translate before emailing or handing out in person should also be translated for posting on GC2.0 Tools. GCpedia and GCconnex are <em>not</em> means by which to eliminate your official languages obligations: all valid offline policies also apply online.</li>
          <li>employees in designated bilingual regions for language-of-work purposes are free to contribute to social media in the language of their choice; this applies to all spheres of their work, including GC2.0 Tools and learning platforms. For example, if you have a page or section in French and a page or section in english where you invite employees to comment, they will not be exact copies of each other, and this is completely legitimate. While there is no obligation to translate drafts and working documents, it is strongly recommended to do so, since Part&nbsp;V of the <em>Official Languages Act</em> states that employees in designated bilingual regions or sectors have the right to work in the official language of their choice. The final versions of the documents must be made available in both official languages.</li>
          <li>It is also important to understand that not all civil servants have the same official languages obligations. For example, public servants in unilingual regions may contribute content to GCpedia and GCconnex in only one official language. Once again, this rule applies both online and offline.</li>
          <li>In the case of a bilingual blog or forum, it is recommended that the blog/&#8203;forum moderator provide regular summaries of posted comments or discussions taking place in both official languages.<sup><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></sup> In order to encourage the use of both official languages, the moderator should lead by example by using both official languages, if possible, and ask for the help of a co&#8209;host, if need be.</li>
          <li>It is important to distinguish between employees' language rights and the linguistic obligations of the School as an organization. When employees provide comments or information in an online forum on their own behalf, they are encouraged to do so in the language of their choice. However, if information or comments are provided on behalf of the School, they must be provided in both official languages. If the information shown comes from the organization, it is recommended to redirect readers to the website where the content is available in both official languages.</li>
