    <h2>Translation and editing Processes</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">
      <img src="~/assets/official_languages/hand-pen.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="auto" class="ajaxed-in float-left">It is important  to have your texts professionally edited and translated. Both the editing and  translation steps must be included in the development process of any document.  The editing process ensures that the text in the language of origin is at its  best and most clear before being sent to translation, thus eliminating a lot of  back-and-forth in the translation step and assuring a professional quality of  language. The translation of content is an important task and you must ensure  that the translated document has the same meaning, sense, nuances and puns that  are found in the original document; this requires time. The translated document  must also be edited.
    </p>
    <p>Thus, good  planning requires anticipating the time required for editing and translation  during the development process and submitting your request as early as possible  (i.e. a few weeks in advance for lengthy texts in order to avoid being late and  paying extra fees for rush jobs).</p>
    <p>Without being a  formal obligation, it should be noted that the importance of translation also  applies to draft documents, notably at key stages of the development process.  The availability of the document in both official languages enables all  employees involved in the process to contribute effectively to the development  regardless of their first official language, thereby possibly resulting in a more  enriched final product.</p>
