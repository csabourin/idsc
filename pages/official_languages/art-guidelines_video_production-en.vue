    <h2>Guidelines for Video Production</h2>
    <p>The School offers video production services. The studio's practices with respect to official languages are outlined below.</p>
    <h4>Videos produced in the two official languages:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Transcription and subtitling of each version</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Videos produced in one official language:</h4>
    <p>Only in the case of interviews or unilingual presentations</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Translation</li>
      <li>Dubbing</li>
      <li>Transcription and subtitling of both versions</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Graphic animation with on-screen text:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Translation</li>
      <li>Transcription and subtitling of the two versions</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Graphic animation in the two official languages with no on-screen text:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Transcription and subtitling of both versions</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Graphic animation in one official language with no on-screen text:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Translation</li>
      <li>Synchronized audio dubbing; unlike an interview, there should be no apparent difference in quality in the version done in the other official language. This means complete postproduction for the other version to synchronize images and sound.</li>
      <li>Transcription and subtitling of both versions</li>
    </ul>
