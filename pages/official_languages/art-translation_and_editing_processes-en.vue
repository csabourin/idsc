      It is important to have your texts professionally edited and translated. The translation step should be included in the production process of any document. Translation should be preceded by editing of the source-language text to ensure its clarity and quality. This eliminates a lot of back and forth and ensures the high quality of the language. The translation of content and review of the translated document are important steps to ensuring that the finished product has the same meaning, sense, and nuances as the original document. Note that all this takes time.
    </p>
    <p>Proper planning therefore involves estimating the time required for editing and translation during the production process and submitting your request as early as possible (i.e.&nbsp;a few weeks in advance for lengthy texts in order to avoid delays and extra fees).</p>
    <p>The importance of translation also applies to draft documents at key stages of production, although the translation of each version is not an obligation. The availability of the document in both official languages at different stages allows all employees involved in the process to contribute effectively to its development, regardless of their first official language, thereby resulting in a better end product.</p>
    <p>In&#8209;house translation and editing services are available at the School. The Learning Technologies and Services team covers the cost of all translation and editing of learning materials. To contact them, write to the <a href="mailto:csps.learningservicerequest-demandeserviceapprentissage.efpc@canada.ca">Learning Technologies and Services</a> team.</p>
