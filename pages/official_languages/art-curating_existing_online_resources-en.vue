    <h2>Curating existing Online Resources</h2>
    <p>Curating existing online content&mdash;which includes researching, sorting, selecting, collecting, organizing and sharing the content as well as the comments on the content&mdash;occupies a place of increasing importance among the duties of instructional designers.</p>
    <p>Seeing as instructional designers represent the School, you are responsible for ensuring that all of the content of the products that you develop is available in both official languages.</p>
    <p>When you want to use externally sourced content (not produced by the School) that is offered in only one official language, the recommended practice is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Translation: Have the content translated into the other official language. Make sure to obtain copyright permission first. For more information on copyrights, check the <a href="https://sb-es-demo.csps-efpc.com/idsc/content_sections/copyright/copyright_FAQS-en.html" target="_blank">Copyright <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQs</abbr></a> section on the School's Support Centre webpage.</li>
      <li>Find equivalent content of the same quality in the other language.</li>
    </ul>
