    <h2>Official Languages Standard</h2>
    <p>The School is not only committed to  respecting its legal obligations, but aims to go beyond what is required by  law. To this end, it has adopted the OÂ­fficial Languages Standard for Service  Delivery to Learner and Client Organizations, which is designed to ensure that  School employees not only respect the linguistic rights of learners and client  organizations but also ensure the School is a leader in Official Languages,  innovate and experiment to improve services and make its work accessible to a  broader audience. </p>
