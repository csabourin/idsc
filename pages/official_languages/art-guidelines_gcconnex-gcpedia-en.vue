    <h3>Open Blogs / Forums</h3>
    <p>Rules on official languages <sup><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The rules that apply to all aspects of your work also apply to GC2.0 Tools. Any document or information that you would usually translate before e-mailing or handing-out in person should also be translated for posting on GC2.0 Tools. GCpedia and GCconnex are <em>not</em> means by which to eliminate your official languages obligations: <em>all valid off-line policies also apply online</em>.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>It is important to define your target public. employees should treat the content they post on GCpedia and GCconnex as if it were an e-mail or a meeting-related contribution. During some meetings, members agree to work in French only or in english only. This is a decision that all committees have the right to make. Note that in virtual classroom training or workshop settings, attendees in other regions of Canada may be present and the unilingual nature of some regions should be considered. It may be important, perhaps even obligatory, to make documents and messages available in the two official languages (e.g. during pan-governmental consultation meetings).</li>
      <li>employees are free to contribute in the language of their choice; this applies to all spheres of their work, including GC2.0 Tools. For example, if you have a page or section in French and a page or section in english, both inviting employees to comment, one will never be a mirror image of the other. And this is perfectly legitimate. While there is no obligation to translate a work in progress, the final product should be available in both official languages.</li>
      <li>It is also important to understand that civil servants do not all have the same official languages obligations. Some unilingual organizations, for example, are a reflection of their regional locations. Public servants in such unilingual regions can therefore contribute content to GCpedia and GCconnex in one language. This rule applies both online and offline.</li>
      <li>In the case of a blog, the blog manager would be well advised to write a bilingual summary of the discussions taking place.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>It is important to distinguish between employee rights and the obligations of the School as an organization. When an employee provides a comment or information on their own behalf, they are free to do so in the language of their choice. If a comment or information is provided on behalf of the School, it must be done so in both official languages.</li>
    </ul>
