    <h2>Guide to Official Languages Best Practices</h2>
    <p>The Canada School of Public Service has the primary responsibility to provide a wide range of learning opportunities and to establish a learning culture for the Public Service that promotes inclusion and supports linguistic duality. In this context, it must offer products and services of equivalent quality in both official languages to provide a learning experience of similar, but not necessarily identical, quality in english and French.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To enable the School to meet its official languages obligations, the School's Official Languages Committee has developed this guide, which is intended to raise employees' awareness of the proper use of official languages, particularly in the development of learning products.</p>
    <p>The guide has been updated to address the recommendations made in the <a href="https://www.clo-ocol.gc.ca/en/publications/audits/2017/csps">Audit of the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages</a> and the establishment of the <a href="http://gcdocs/otcs/llisapi.dll/properties/11315201">Official Languages Standard for employees of the Canada School of Public Service for the Provision of Services to Learners and Client Organizations</a>.</p>
