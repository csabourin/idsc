    <h2><abbr title="Official Languages">OL</abbr> Guidelines for GCcampus Content</h2>
    <h3>Virtual or Traditional Classroom Courses</h3>
    <p>Virtual classroom courses should be dealt with in the same way as traditional classroom courses with respect to official languages obligations. Separate sessions in each official language ensure that public servants have access not only to training in the official language of their choice, but to equivalent content in both languages.</p>

    <h3>events, Workshops, Webcasts</h3>
    <p>The events and in&#8209;person workshops or webcasts offered by the School are often bilingual. However, when offered in only one language, it is important that the School provide substantially the same number in French and english.</p>
    <p>These activities must be bilingual when they are intended for members of the two linguistic communities in designated bilingual regions.</p>
    <p>Recommended practice for bilingual events:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the members of the two linguistic communities participate in an activity, the organizers and presenters must make sure that all are able to follow and take part in the official language of their choice. This must be mentioned at the beginning of the event.</li>
      <li>Set up two screens: one presentation in english and one in French. Participants have the right to use the official language of their choice, and facilitators should alternate equally between the two languages to ensure their equal representation.</li>
      <li>When it is not possible to use two screens, it is best to present english and French slides alternately and to make sure that the presentation is distributed to participants in both official languages so they can follow along at all times.</li>
      <li>You may also request simultaneous interpretation services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consult with the Conferences and Special events (CASe) group about the use of official languages for events, workshops and webcasts.</p>

    <h3>Self-paced Online Courses</h3>
    <p>Self-paced online courses must be available simultaneously in the two official languages. Language training courses must be available in both official languages in an equivalent manner.</p>
    <p>Help options or Frequently Asked Questions must be available in the two official languages.</p>
    <p>It is important to provide diligent and appropriate follow&#8209;up to comments received on course-related official languages issues (e.g.&nbsp;ensure language quality).</p>

    <h3>Piloting of New Courses and Other Learning Products</h3>
    <p>Where pilot testing is taking place in designated bilingual regions, it must be conducted simultaneously in both official languages.</p>
    <p>Once a product is ready to be launched&mdash;that is, it is completed in both official languages&mdash;it should be piloted using control groups from both official language communities.</p>

    <h3>Use of Images</h3>
    <p>The School currently holds a corporate account with the <a href="www.gettyimages.com" target="_blank">Getty</a> image bank, from which users can download images. Note that although Getty images contain english-only text, one of the School's programmers can insert French text for you. You may use other sources of images for product-development purposes but make sure to obtain copyright permission first. When in doubt, contact the <a href="mailto:csps.copyrightdroitsdauteurs.efpc@canada.ca">Copyright Centre</a>.</p>
    <p>Recommended practice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select text-free images</li>
      <li>Find a different image that conveys the same message and that contains text in the course language.</li>
      <li>Ask the <a href="mailto:csps.learningservicerequest-demandeserviceapprentissage.efpc@canada.ca">Multimedia Development and Desktop Publishing</a> team for help.</li>
    </ul>
